/* 
Time Complexity :-
Algorithm quantifying the amount of time taken by an algoritm to run as a function of the length of the input.

Types of Notations :- 
  1] O-Notation(Big O)
      Represents the upper bound of an algorithm's time complexity in worst-case scenario.
  2] Ω-Notation(Omega)
      Represents the lower bound of an algorithm's time complexity in best-case scenario.
  3] Θ-Notation(Theta)
      Represents the tight bound of an algorithm, capturing both upper and lower bounds.

Space Complexity :-
Algorithm quantifying the amount of time taken by a program to run as a function of length of the input.
